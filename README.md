## üîªDownloading the project

[This](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository) GitHub guide can walk you through cloning the repo. 

## üöÄ Quick Start

 1. Make a .env file at the root of the server directory, with your values for the variables in server/env.sample

 2. Start [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Let it run in the background.

 3. From the root directory run the following to install all dependencies and create the database:
    
    `npm run dev-quick-setup` 

 4. After it is complete wait a few seconds for your database container to start running

 5. From the root run the following to run the migrations and seed the database (it will be cleared first):
   
    `npm run dev-quick-server`

 6. Run the application in development mode:
  
    `npm run dev`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick resume
Assuming you've already installed all dependencies, created the database, run all migrations and seeded the database:
1. Start the database container and run the app in development mode:
   
   `npm run dev-quick-resume`
   
   OR

2. If the database container is already running, start the app in development mode:
   
   `npm run dev`

## üóÑ Setting up the server

<b>Database structure</b>

The ERD for the database can be found [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/612bbd55825b5b0146e9aed7) and in the boop-db.png image in the project root.

### üìÑ Setting up Environment Variables

1. Make a .env file at the root of the server directory, with your values for the variables in server/env.sample. 
2. Make a .env.production file at the root of the server directory, with your values for the variables in server/env.production.sample

### Getting the server to work

1. Docker
    1. If you don't have docker desktop download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Make sure it's running.
    2. Create your container and database:
        1. From the root:
    
            `npm run server-docker-compose`

        OR

        2. From the server sub directory:

            `docker-compose up -d`

2. Run database migrations to create your tables in the database in docker (container MUST be running) using:

    1. Make sure you have all needed dependencies:
    
        In the project root run:

        `npm run install-all-deps`

    2. Run the migrations:

       1. from root:
       
           `npm run server-migration`

           OR

       2. from server sub-dir 
        
           `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate `
    
3. Run the application in development mode using (in the root):
    
    `npm run dev`

4. (Optional) Use the [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) VSCode extension to test the routes. Here's a [JSON file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14SfX97UpaPSqzPgeuLMLAoRXbzHXtx0O?usp=sharing) with some sample queries.

        Under site URL enter "http://localhost:3000" and click save.
        No need to click continue.
    
    6. Go to settings on the left and select basic.
        Copy the app ID into the .env file in the FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID variable.
        Click show next to the App secret.
        Copy the app secret into the .env file in the FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET variable.

## üíª Using the client

1. Ensure you've followed all previous setup instructions.
2. Ensure the database container is running:
   1. Start your container in the docker desktop app
   
        OR

   2. In the project root run:
   
        `npm run docker-start`

3. Run the server and client in development mode:
  
    In the project root run:

    `npm run dev`

## üêã Building a docker image

To build the docker image yourself you can use `docker build -t boop:0.1.0 .` while in the root of the project. This will read and perform the actions described in the Dockerfile. Ensure you have all the appropriate env vars set.

Once the image is built, a container can be created from the image with the docker-compose file located in the root of the project. You will need to pass docker-compose the required env vars for each container (boop app and postgres). For example: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file server/.env up -d`.

The app should then be accessible on port 8080. From here you will need to run the database migration before you can login to the app.

## ‚ò∏ Deploying to Kubernetes Digital Ocean

1. Make sure your env variables in server/.env.production have the correct values.
   
2. Obtain your yaml key for `kubectl` from DigitalOcean in Kubernetes overview section, with the download config file button. This is required if your are using kubectl to manage the kubernetes cluster; this is not required for `doctl`.

    <i>If you are using a *nix system, the deploy-script.bash script can run the following commands automatically. Simply pass the path to the yaml key for kubectl as the first arg (in project root: `./deploy-script.bash <path to yaml key>`).</i>

3. Use `npm run make-yaml-secrets` in the project root to create a secret yaml file (./boop-secret.yaml). The secrets can be pushed to DigitalOcean with kubectl using the command `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" apply -f /path/to/your/secret.yaml`.

4. The HOME_URL var in the boop-deployment.yaml file needs to be filled in with the url to be used for the app. You can then push the deployment to DigitalOcean using `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" create -f ../path/to/boop-deployment.yaml`.

5. To create the service to expose the created pods to the outside world, use the boop-service.yaml. The command to push is `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" apply -f /path/to/boop-service.yaml`.

## ‚ò∏ Redeploying to Kubernetes Digital Ocean

If you want to update the env variables used after previously deploying to Kubernetes Digital Ocean:

1. Update the env values in your server/.env.production file
   
    <i>If you are using a *nix system, the redeploy-script.bash script can run the following commands automatically. Simply pass the path to the yaml key for kubectl as the first arg (in project root: `./redeploy-script.bash <path to yaml key>`).</i>

2. Delete the current deployment using `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" delete deployment boop-deployment`

3. Use `npm run make-yaml-secrets` in the project root to create a secret yaml file (./boop-secret.yaml) with the updated env values. The secrets can be pushed to DigitalOcean with kubectl using the command `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" apply -f /path/to/your/secret.yaml`.

4. The HOME_URL var in the boop-deployment.yaml file needs to be filled in with the url to be used for the app. You can then push the deployment to DigitalOcean using `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" create -f ../path/to/boop-deployment.yaml`.

5. To create the service to expose the created pods to the outside world, use the boop-service.yaml. The command to push is `kubectl --kubeconfig="/path/to/your/yaml/key" apply -f /path/to/boop-service.yaml`.
